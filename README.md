This is a server to dish out question based on random numbers.  It reads in the list.json file and selects an element from that object.  

The list2JSON.py script will take a numbered list and build a json file from that list.

Currently the server allows the user to generate randomly selected questions.  The server will not repeat a questions unless the 'skip' button is selected instead of the 'next' button.  It also allows the user to start a new game.
